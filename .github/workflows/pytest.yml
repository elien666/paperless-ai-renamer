# This workflow runs pytest on:
# - Every push to non-default branches (any branch except 'main')
# - Every pull request targeting the default branch ('main')
#
# To fully guard PRs and require passing tests before merge:
# 1. Go to GitHub repository Settings > Branches
# 2. Add a branch protection rule for 'main'
# 3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
# 4. Select "test" (this job) as a required check

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Skip if push event is to main/master branch
    if: github.event_name != 'push' || (github.ref != 'refs/heads/main' && github.ref != 'refs/heads/master')
