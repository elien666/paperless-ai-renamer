# This workflow runs pytest on:
# - Every push to non-default branches (any branch except 'main')
# - Every pull request targeting the default branch ('main')
#
# To fully guard PRs and require passing tests before merge:
# 1. Go to GitHub repository Settings > Branches
# 2. Add a branch protection rule for 'main'
# 3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
# 4. Select "test" (this job) as a required check

    branches-ignore:
      - main  # Skip pushes to default branch, only run on non-default branches
